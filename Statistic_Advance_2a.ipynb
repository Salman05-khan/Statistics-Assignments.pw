        "Hypothesis testing in statistics is a method to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.\n",

        "In simple words: It helps us check if a claim (assumption) about a population is true or not using data.\n",

        "Steps of Hypothesis Testing:\n",
        "\n",
        "State hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "Null hypothesis (H₀): Assumes no effect or no difference. (e.g., \"The average height of students = 165 cm\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternative hypothesis (H₁): Assumes there is an effect or a difference. (e.g., \"The average height ≠ 165 cm\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Choose significance level (α):\n",
        "\n",
        "Commonly 0.05 (5% chance of error).\n",

        "\n",
        "If p > α, fail to reject H₀ → not enough evidence against H₀.\n",
